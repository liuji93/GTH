Unfortunately, the original code cannot be shared, due to the Tencent Youtu Lab's IP policy.  <br /> 
Instead, another MATLAB implementation of OCH has been released, which details are similar to the original version, but it would be still useful and gives similar results.

This package contains cleaned up codes for the AAAI paper, including:  <br />
test_OCH.m: the demo test codes  <br />
trainOCH.m: function to train the OCH model  <br />
constructure_data.m: function to construct the data set  <br />
compressOCH.m: function to generate the hash code  <br />
LabelMe.mat: a random subset of the original LabelMe dataset
